# CST-391: FaithTrack Milestone - Project Proposal

## Cover Sheet

**Class Number & Title:** CST-391: Database & Web Application Development  
**Application Name:** FaithTrack  
**Author:** Matt Kollar  

## **1. Introduction**
FaithTrack is a web application designed to help users manage a collection of faith-based resources, such as Bible verses, devotionals, prayers, and Christian books. The application will provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality along with additional features like search and categorization. This project will be implemented with an Express.js backend, a MySQL database, and two front-end frameworks: Angular and React.

## **2. Functionality Requirements**
- **As a user, I want to create a new faith-based resource** so that I can share it with others.
- **As a user, I want to view a list of all faith-based resources** so that I can browse what is available.
- **As a user, I want to search for specific resources by name or category** so that I can find relevant content quickly.
- **As a user, I want to update a resourceâ€™s details** so that I can keep the information accurate.
- **As a user, I want to delete a resource** so that I can remove outdated or irrelevant content.
- **As a user, I want to filter resources by category** so that I can explore specific types of faith-based content.
